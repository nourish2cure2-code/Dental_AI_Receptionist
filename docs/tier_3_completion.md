# Tier 3 Completion Report: Live Booking & Core Polish

**Objective:** Finalize the revenue-generating features (Live Calendar Booking, Conversion CTA) and lock down the production architecture.

### 1. Live Calendar Booking (The Differentiator)
*   **What was done:** We evolved the AI from a lead-qualifier to a true appointment setter. We added the `checkCalendarAvailability` and `bookAppointment` tools to Vapi, created the strict multi-tenant `appointments` database schema, and built the tool-call interception routing in the Edge Function.
*   **Why it was done:** Booking live on the call removes the friction of "we'll call you back to schedule." For the MVP, the availability check returns a hardcoded "Tomorrow at 10 AM or 2 PM" to guarantee demo success during sales pitches.

### 2. Edge Function Hardening
*   **What was done:** Added a `deno test` suite (`index.test.ts`) that asserts the webhook correctly routes `tool-calls` vs `end-of-call-report` payloads and skips irrelevent pings.
*   **Why it was done:** The webhook is the single point of failure for the entire system. Automated payload tests protect it from edit-churn and regressions.

### 3. Documentation & Schema Alignment
*   **What was done:** Updated `database/supabase_schema.sql` so that it accurately reflects the live schema built in Tier 1 and 2. Purged references to the non-existent PRD from `CLAUDE.md`.
*   **Why it was done:** Stale documentation leads to corrupted migrations later on. The architecture is now the single source of truth.

### 4. Deployment Mechanics
*   **What was done:** The landing page's passive `mailto:` CTA was replaced with a direct Calendly booking link to capture agency sales. Verified that Cloudflare Pages should target the raw `bajadental_site/` directory (no build step necessary).

### Pending Manual Steps (Ops)
To take the platform fully live, you will need to execute the following operational steps:
1.  **Inject Telnyx Secrets:** Run the Supabase CLI command to set `TELNYX_API_KEY`, `TELNYX_PHONE_NUMBER`, and `CLINIC_ALERT_PHONE` to activate the SMS alerts.
2.  **Model Evaluation:** The assistant is currently running `gpt-4o-mini`. For the MVP this is acceptable, but if the Spanglish switching proves too slow or robotic during your local testing, it should be bumped to `gpt-4o`.
