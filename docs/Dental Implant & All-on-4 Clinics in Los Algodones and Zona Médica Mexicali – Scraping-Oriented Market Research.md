## Objective

This report maps high-value dental implant and All-on-4 providers in **Los Algodones** and **Zona Médica, Mexicali**, and translates their public web presence into a scraping-oriented view: which pages to target, what pricing and procedures are available, and where staff names are exposed.

## Market overview

Los Algodones (“Molar City”) is one of the densest dental tourism hubs globally, with many clinics publishing detailed English-language price lists for implants, crowns, and full-arch treatments, often 50–80% cheaper than U.S. pricing.  All-on-4 packages in Los Algodones commonly range roughly **8,000–14,000 USD per arch**, depending on implant brand and prosthetic material.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5]
Zona Médica in Mexicali is a compact medical district a few minutes from the border where multi-specialty clinics (including dental) market to patients from California, Arizona, and Nevada with implant prices often **around 700–1,000 USD per implant** and full-arch All-on-4 treatments typically **8,000–10,000 USD+ per arch**.  Aggregator sites (Bookimed, Dental Departures, FlyHospital, DentaVacation) verify these ranges and provide additional cross-checked pricing for Mexicali.[^6][^7][^8][^9][^10][^11]

***

## Data model for scraping

To support price comparison, lead generation, or a clinic directory, you can structure your data roughly as:

- **Clinic**: id, name, brand group, website, email/phone, city, neighborhood (e.g., “Zona Médica”), geo coordinates, languages, aggregators linking to it.
- **Location**: id, city, country, neighborhood, distance to border crossing, notes on access.
- **Procedure**: id, canonical name (e.g., “All-on-4 dental implants”), local labels ("All-on-4", "All-on-Four", "Implantes All-on-4"), category (implant, full-arch, crown, graft, etc.).
- **PricePoint**: clinic_id, procedure_id, label on page, advertised price (min, max), currency, per-unit basis (per arch, per jaw, per implant), included services (anesthesia, temporary prosthesis, scans), source_url, last_seen_at.
- **Staff**: id, clinic_id, full_name, role (implantologist, prosthodontist, general dentist, anesthesiologist, manager), credentials, bio snippet, languages, profile_url.

This schema lets you normalize very heterogeneous content from different sites while still preserving exact labels and URLs for auditing.

## High-value clinics – Los Algodones (implants & All-on-4)

### Sani Dental Group (Los Algodones)

Sani Dental Group publishes a detailed, English-language price list with line items for single implants, crowns, and All-on-4 variants.  Their pricing includes **All-on-4 systems with acrylic hybrid fixed denture per arch around 8,110–9,710 USD**, depending on brand (Nobel vs Straumann), plus separate entries for standard implant crowns and zygomatic/pterygoid implants.[^5]
For scraping, their PlacidWay/clinic price list page is a clean table with columns: procedure, details, price (USD), which maps nicely into your `PricePoint` model.[^12][^5]

**Key pages to target**
- Price list (PlacidWay mirror): tabular data for implants, All-on-4, crowns, bone grafts.[^12][^5]
- Main site (sanidentalgroup.com): services pages for implants, All-on-4, and potentially an “Our Doctors” / team section (structure suitable for staff scraping, though names are not in the cited excerpts).

**Scraping notes**
- Price tables are semantically structured (`<table>`), with procedure names like **"All on Four" System with Acrylic Hybrid Fixed Denture (Upper or lower arch)**, and clear numeric prices in USD.[^5]
- You can pattern-match procedure names containing `All on 4`, `All-on-4`, `All on Four`, as well as implant-related keywords (`Implant`, `Overdenture`, `Zygomatic`, `Pterygoid`).

***

### Algodones Dental Center

Algodones Dental Center advertises strong price anchors on its homepage, such as **All-on-4 Implant 8,110 USD**, **zirconia crown 490 USD**, and **porcelain veneer 450 USD**, framed explicitly as U.S. vs local savings.  The site positions itself on savings of up to **80%** compared with U.S. pricing and highlights full dentures and other prosthetic work.[^13]

**Key pages to target**
- Homepage / pricing section highlighting All-on-4, crowns, veneers, dentures with side-by-side U.S. vs Algodones prices.[^13]

**Scraping notes**
- Pricing is often in marketing blocks rather than a formal `<table>`, but still uses consistent numeric formatting (e.g., `$8,110`).[^13]
- Include logic to capture U.S. “reference price” as an optional field on `PricePoint` for perceived savings.

***

### Dental Del Rio (Los Algodones)

Dental Del Rio publishes a comprehensive 2026 price list with multiple implant SKUs: standard titanium dental implant **750 USD**, Straumann **950 USD**, Nobel Biocare **1,000 USD**, zirconia **1,200 USD**, and zygomatic implants **2,500 USD**.  The same page lists prices for crown types, dentures, extractions, and other common restorative procedures.[^3]

**Key pages to target**
- `/price-list/` – tabular price list covering implants, crowns, grafts, dentures, and extra services.[^3]

**Scraping notes**
- The price list is a long, structured table, so you can iterate over rows and classify procedures by matching terms like `Implant`, `Crown`, `All-on-4`, `Bone graft`, and `Sinus lift` in the first column.[^3]
- Currency is specified as U.S. dollars; ensure your parser captures that for normalization.[^3]

***

### Novadent Dental Clinic (Los Algodones)

Novadent advertises a price comparison table between typical U.S. prices and its own Los Algodones pricing, including a line for **Standard Titanium Dental Implant (implant only)** showing U.S. pricing around **2,100 USD** vs significantly lower local pricing.  The page positions many procedures (implants, crowns, bone graft) as base or “starting at” prices.[^14]

**Key pages to target**
- `los-algodones-dental-price-list` – comparison table U.S. vs Novadent for implants and restorative procedures.[^14]

**Scraping notes**
- Table layout is again straightforward; include a boolean field like `is_starting_price` since the site labels prices as “starting at.”[^14]
- Map U.S. comparative pricing into a secondary price field if you want to model perceived savings.

***

### Marietta Dental Care (Los Algodones branch)

Marietta Dental Care operates in Los Algodones and Tijuana and lists a broad suite of treatments including **All-on-4**, All-on-6, bone grafting, standard implants, and full-mouth reconstruction.  Their All-on-4 pricing sheet states **All-on-4 per arch between 8,500 and 13,900 USD** and All-on-6 in the **9,500–14,500 USD** range, compared against U.S. benchmarks of 25,000–55,000 USD per arch.  Another page quotes implant-supported crowns from **1,550 USD** and All-on-6 implants starting at **9,999 USD**, plus IV sedation priced roughly **600–700 USD** depending on duration.[^15][^16][^4]

**Key pages to target**
- `/services/all-on-4-dental-implants/` – All-on-4 and All-on-6 overview with summarized pricing bands and comparison table vs U.S. prices.[^4]
- `/services/dental-implants/cost/` – more detailed implant/crown cost breakdown and sedation pricing.[^16]

**Scraping notes**
- Prices are mostly in textual paragraphs and simple comparison tables, so include both regex-based extraction and table parsing.[^16][^4]
- Capture ranges (min, max) when present, not just a single value.

***

### LOVAL Dental (Los Algodones)

LOVAL Dental markets **All-on-4 arch restoration** with advertised bundles beginning at **10,000 USD per arch**, emphasizing that this is “significantly less” than typical U.S. pricing.  They outline what is included (placement of four implants, temporary fixed teeth in about five days, follow-ups) and highlight their team’s training and affiliations (e.g., ADA, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, AAID).[^17]

**Key pages to target**
- `/services/all-on-4-dental-implants/` – package overview, pricing anchor, and list of included services.[^17]

**Scraping notes**
- Pricing is given as a clear “bundles begin at” value; store this as a starting price and record inclusions in a JSON field on the procedure (e.g., includes scans, temp prosthesis, follow-ups).[^17]

**Staff examples**
- LOVAL’s All-on-4 page mentions specific clinicians: **Dr. Rafael Lopez** (implantologist), **Dr. Jesus Mayoral** (prosthodontist), and **Dr. Vanessa Mendoza** (general dentist).  These names are extractable via patterns like `Dr.` followed by two or three tokens and can seed your `Staff` table.[^17]

***

### Dental Solutions Algodones (team-focused example)

Dental Solutions Algodones showcases an “Our Team” page featuring a multi-role staff list with names, roles, and brief bios.  Named staff include **Eng. Mitzi Bojorquez (General Manager)**, **DDS Karen Caballero (Prosthodontics Specialist)**, **DDS Maximo Torres (Oral Surgery & Implants Expert)**, **DDS Emmanuel Castañedo (Senior Dentist)**, **DDS Daniel Sierra (Senior Dentist)**, **DDS Hector Duran (Oral Surgery & Implants Expert)**, **DDS Hector Palma (Orthodontic Specialist)**, **DDS Daniela Fernandez (Orthodontic Specialist)**, and diagnostic staff such as **Abril Reyes**.[^18]

**Key pages to target**
- `/our-team/` – dense staff listing with role labels and section headers; ideal as a model for staff-name extraction.[^18]

**Scraping notes**
- This page uses name headings followed by role descriptions; a robust pattern is to capture `<h3>` / `<h4>` elements containing `DDS`, `Dr.`, or `Eng.` and then the subsequent paragraph as a role/bio.[^18]

***

### Supreme Dental Clinic (Los Algodones)

Supreme Dental Clinic positions itself as a premium, accreditation-heavy provider with an emphasis on full-arch implant cases, including **All-on-4**, All-on-6, pterygoid, and zygomatic implants.  The site stresses international training, in-house lab capabilities, and use of advanced technology such as PIC Dental scanners for precise full-arch prosthesis fabrication.[^19]

**Key pages to target**
- Homepage and services sections for implants, All-on-4, and full mouth reconstruction.[^19]
- “Meet the team” section and AI-based app / smile preview flows that may expose named clinicians.[^19]

**Scraping notes**
- While explicit numeric prices are not in the cited snippet, the services taxonomy is rich; you can still scrape procedure names and map them to your canonical procedures.

***

### Castle Dental Group (Los Algodones)

Castle Dental provides **itemized All-on-4 pricing** by treatment phase: first visit (implant placement) is **8,000 USD** for non-immediate loading or **9,000 USD** for immediate loading, and the second stage adds **6,000–6,500 USD** to complete the total per-arch cost.  Sedation is listed around **700 USD** as an additional line item.[^20]

**Key pages to target**
- `/services/all-on-4-dental-implants/` – includes definition of All-on-4 vs All-on-6, staged cost breakdown, and procedural steps.[^20]

**Scraping notes**
- Text is in paragraph form rather than a formal table; use regex to capture currency amounts near keywords like `All-on-4`, `first visit`, `second stage`, `sedation`.[^20]

***

## High-value clinics – Mexicali (Zona Médica emphasis)

### DG Dental Mexicali (Zona Médica)

DG Dental, located in Mexicali’s medical district, publishes a very detailed price list via DentaVacation, covering implants, All-on-4/6/8, grafting, dentures, root canals, and orthodontics.  The list shows **titanium implants at 700 USD**, **abutments 150 USD**, **crowns on implants 300 USD**, and a combined implant+abutment+crown option at **1,000 USD** per tooth.  All-on-4 packages including a fixed hybrid acrylic bridge per jaw are listed at **4,800 USD**, with **All-on-6 at 6,200 USD** and **All-on-8 at 7,600 USD** per jaw.[^9][^21]

**Key pages to target**
- DentaVacation listing price tables: multiple sections categorized by procedure type (implants, dentures, root canals, cosmetic, orthodontics).[^9]
- DG Dental’s own site (`dgdentalmexicali.com`) All-on-4 page describing their full fixed arch implant program and experience.[^22]

**Scraping notes**
- DentaVacation uses clean `<table>` elements; each row includes a procedure name, details, price, and sometimes days.
- Use a clinic_id mapping that links aggregator records back to the DG Dental brand, and mark `source_type` as `aggregator` to distinguish from first-party clinic pages.

***

### Skydent / Mexicali Dental Implants (Zona Médica)

The Skydent group promotes “Top Dentists in Mexicali” with a clinic location at **Calle B #199 between Reforma and Madero**, explicitly in **Zona Médica Mexicali**.  Their implant-specific pages advertise **implants from around 649 USD**, emphasizing affordability and 10+ years of experience.  Another Skydent-branded page markets “Mexicali dental implants prices start at 499 USD,” offering free estimates and promoting their competitive pricing for implant treatments.[^23][^24][^25]

**Key pages to target**
- `dentistasenmexicali.com` – general clinic/brand page describing the Zona Médica location and office hours.[^25]
- `implantes-dentales-mexicali-precios-2-2` – implants pricing page with starting-from prices and messaging around Zona Médica.[^24]
- `mexicali-dental-implants-prices` – additional pricing-focused landing page for Skydent with phone contact and price anchors.[^23]

**Scraping notes**
- Pricing is mostly “from” amounts, so capture `price_min` and set `is_starting_price` true.
- These pages are likely Spanish-first; include Spanish keywords like `implantes dentales`, `precios`, `Zona Médica` when pattern matching.

***

### Ovperiodontist (Mexicali)

Ovperiodontist, a periodontist in Mexicali near Los Algodones, provides an extensive price comparison table across periodontal surgery, implants, crowns, and dentures.  Their implant section lists **Straumann or Nobel Biocare implants at 899 USD** (implant and surgery), a lower-cost Neodent standard implant at **799 USD**, **standard implant crowns including abutment at 750 USD**, and **All-on-4 dental implants per arch at 8,250 USD** compared to a 24,000 USD U.S. price.[^7]

**Key pages to target**
- `/prices` – multi-section table including periodontal surgeries, implants, grafts, extractions, crowns, veneers, and dentures, each with U.S. vs local prices and savings percentages.[^7]

**Scraping notes**
- Because the page repeats `Dental Treatments` header rows across sections, you will need to segment tables or skip header repeats during parsing.
- It is a strong template for modeling savings vs U.S. prices and for differentiating premium brands (Straumann, Nobel) vs standard implants (Neodent).

***

### Hospital de la Familia (Mexicali)

Hospital de la Familia operates as a multi-specialty hospital with dental implant services marketed heavily to international patients via Bookimed.  Bookimed cites standard implant prices around **950 USD** and All-on-4 packages in Mexicali close to **9,850 USD**, including implant surgery, short hospital stay, and shuttle transfers.[^10][^6]

**Key pages to target**
- Bookimed clinic pages for Hospital de la Familia – contain summarized implant pricing, doctor experience, and package inclusions.[^6][^10]

**Scraping notes**
- As with DG Dental, Bookimed is an aggregator; treat it as a secondary source if your main product is focused on first-party clinic sites.

***

### General Mexicali dental implant pricing

Multiple aggregator sites (FlyHospital, Dental Departures, booking portals) cluster standard single-implant prices in Mexicali around **750 USD**, with full-mouth implants about **12,000 USD**, representing up to **70% savings** vs U.S. prices.  All-on-4 treatments in Mexicali are commonly advertised near **8,950–9,850 USD per arch** across verified clinics.[^8][^26][^27][^11][^10]

These ranges help you sanity-check per-clinic scraped data—major deviations likely indicate either premium materials, special cases, or out-of-date pages.

***

## Procedure taxonomy – especially All-on-4

Across both Los Algodones and Mexicali, clinics use a mix of English and Spanish labels for similar procedures:

- **All-on-4 variants**: `All-on-4`, `All on 4`, `All-on-Four`, `"All on Four" System`, sometimes simply `full fixed arch implant` or `full mouth dental implants`.[^2][^28][^22][^20]
- **All-on-6 / All-on-8**: `All-on-6`, `All-on-8` sometimes grouped under All-on-4 pricing sections.[^4][^22][^9]
- **Single implants**: `Standard Titanium Dental Implant`, brand-specific implants such as `Straumann`, `Nobel Biocare`, `Neodent`, and generic `Titanium Implant`.[^7][^9][^3]
- **Grafting/sinus**: `Bone graft`, `Socket preservation`, `Sinus lifting` (often with “starts at” pricing).[^9][^7]

Normalizing these into canonical procedure IDs while retaining raw labels will let you build robust filters in your product while preserving exact marketing language.

***

## Staff-name extraction patterns

Staff names matter for authority signals, outreach, and credibility. In these markets they usually appear in:

- **Team pages** like Dental Solutions Algodones’ "Our Team" page, which lists each clinician and role in structured headings.[^18]
- **Procedure pages** that highlight key implantologists or founders, such as Dr. Jose Valenzuela Jr. at a Los Algodones implant practice, and Dr. Mario Garibay at SoftDentalCare with 900+ All-on-4 procedures.[^29][^30]
- **Clinic descriptions** listing lead dentists and key staff, like LOVAL Dental’s implantologist and prosthodontist team or DG Dental’s emphasis on its implant dentistry experience.[^22][^17]

**Pattern examples**
- Prefix-based: match tokens starting with `Dr.`, `DDS`, `DMD`, `Eng.` followed by 2–3 words, optionally including middle initials.
- Role proximity: after a matched name, capture nearby text containing words like `implantologist`, `prosthodontist`, `general dentist`, `oral surgery`, `periodontist`, `general manager` to populate the `role` and `specialty` fields.
- Section heuristics: on dedicated team pages, each staff block often uses an `<h3>` or `<h4>` with the name and a following `<p>` or `<span>` for the role.[^18]

***

## Scraping strategy and implementation notes

### Technology stack

Given the mix of simple static pages and more modern marketing sites, a reasonable implementation stack would be:

- **Playwright or Puppeteer (Node.js/TypeScript)** for robust rendering and navigation, especially when sites use client-side frameworks or lazy-loaded content.
- **Cheerio** for second-stage HTML parsing once you have the page HTML.
- A small **domain ruleset** per clinic brand that defines:
  - Primary clinic URLs (homepage, price list, implant/All-on-4 pages, team page).
  - Expected patterns for tables, price anchors, and staff sections.

### Target URL strategy

Start with a curated seed list (like the clinics above), then discover:

- Price pages via URL patterns: `/price-list`, `/prices`, `/dental-implants/cost`, `/all-on-4-dental-implants`.[^16][^4][^20][^3]
- Procedure pages via URL and link-text search for `All-on-4`, `All on 4`, `Implantes dentales`, `Implante dental`.[^28][^2][^22]
- Staff pages via links containing `our team`, `equipo`, `doctors`, `dentists`.

### Extraction heuristics

1. **Pricing**  
   - Prefer `<table>` structures where the first cell is procedure name and a later cell is price.[^12][^5][^7][^9][^3]
   - Fallback to regex scanning for currency patterns `(\$\s?\d[\d,]*(?:\.\d{2})?)` within sections containing implant or All-on-4 keywords.
   - Detect ranges (`8,500–13,900`) and split into min/max fields.[^4]

2. **Procedures**  
   - Tokenize procedure labels and map them to canonical IDs using a synonym dictionary (e.g., `All-on-4`, `"All on Four" System`, `full mouth dental implants`).[^2][^28][^20]

3. **Staff**  
   - On team pages, iterate through heading tags and collect names and role strings.[^18]
   - On procedure pages, look for “Meet Dr.” sections, or lines like `Dr. X has performed 900+ All-on-4 procedures` (e.g., Dr. Mario Garibay).[^29]

### Frequency, legality, and robustness

- Check and respect each site’s **robots.txt** and terms of use, and throttle your crawlers to low QPS to avoid disruption.
- For aggregators (Bookimed, DentalDepartures, DentaVacation), consider using them primarily as **cross-check sources**; they may have stricter scraping restrictions than individual clinic sites.[^11][^10][^6][^9]
- Implement **change detection** so you can re-scrape only when content has changed materially (e.g., hashing the relevant DOM subtree for a price table).

***

## How to operationalize this

1. Seed a **clinic list** with the brands above, tagging each as Los Algodones or Mexicali (Zona Médica where applicable).  
2. For each clinic, define **URL rules** for price tables, implant/All-on-4 pages, and staff/team pages based on the patterns and examples in this report.[^16][^20][^4][^3][^18]
3. Build a **scraping pipeline** that fetches, parses, and normalizes prices and staff into your data model, logging source URLs and timestamps for every data point.  
4. Use aggregator data to **validate ranges** and detect outliers (e.g., All-on-4 under 3,000 USD or over 20,000 USD in these markets is likely incorrect or context-specific).[^27][^8][^11]
5. Layer product logic on top (lead scoring, price comparison, outreach prioritization) using procedure mix (implants vs general dentistry), price positioning, and staff seniority as features.
