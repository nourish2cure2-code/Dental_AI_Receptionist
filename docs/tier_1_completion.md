# Tier 1 Completion Report: Pre-Pitch Essentials

**Objective:** Stabilize the baseline architecture and mitigate immediate legal/security liabilities before scaling the AI Receptionist to additional clinics.

### 1. Refactored Knowledge Base into a Strict Template
*   **What was done:** We overhauled `docs/dental_tourism_knowledge_base.txt`. All hardcoded medical and financial claims were removed and replaced with bracketed template variables (e.g., `[ALL_ON_4_PRICE_RANGE]`, `[WARRANTY_TERMS]`). We added a strict warning header requiring manual verification during onboarding.
*   **Why it was done:** The previous knowledge base stated definitive facts (such as OSHA-level sterilization, board-certification, and lifetime guarantees) as universal truths. Deploying that knowledge base universally would expose the agency to severe medical and legal liability if a specific clinic failed to meet those standards. The template forces fact-checking per tenant.

### 2. Secret Rotation (Deferred)
*   **What was done:** This task was explicitly skipped for now.
*   **Why it was done:** While keys (Vapi, Telnyx, Supabase) were leaked in prior chat logs, you requested to bypass rotation to maintain momentum on core architectural features. This remains a known technical debt item.
